In the spring of 2017, the graduate students of the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the State University of New York Center formed the Physics Graduate Student Association (PGSA) at Stony Brook University (SBU), with the intention of strengthening the community of and sense of camaraderie among the graduate students of the Department and improving the lines of communication between the graduate students, the Department, the campus community, and the public.

The PGSA serves to promote interactions between graduate students in the Department and those interested in interacting with its community; acts as a forum wherein students may discuss ideas physical, political, bureaucratic, or otherwise in nature, as they pertain to them, focusing specifically on problems and potential resolutions; aims to provide a voice and enable due democratic process to resolve issues pertaining to graduate students within the Department; and strives to maintain a welcoming environment to facilitate the acclimation of new students to the Department and ensure their continued success.
